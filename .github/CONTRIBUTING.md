## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do I need to know to contribute to the codebase?

Stylus runs on JavaScript and CSS. If you're interested in contributing to the codebase, you will need to be familiar with JavaScript, and some technologies like NPM.

### How can I report a new bug?

If you've encountered a bug, do the following steps first to resolve the problem:
1. **Ask for help in the Discussion forum**. 
2. **Search for your issue on GitHub**. If you've seen your issue being discussed in the discussion section, chances are that it may have a post on the issue section. If an existing post exists, be sure to thumbs up the author's post in the issue thread.
3. **Create a New Issue**: After doing the above and not encountering any previously mentioned issues, then create a new issue. See the full issue template [here](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md)

### Where do I start if I want to work on an issue?

Head over to the Issues section and go through any _help wanted_ issues for a quick list of all issues that are available to be worked on. These issues are available to anyone and do not require permission.
